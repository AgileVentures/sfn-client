## What is a persona?

Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas will help you to understand your usersâ€™ needs, experiences, behaviours and goals.

## What are the main personas for Sing for Needs?

We identified 3 main groups for this mission: the artists, the causes (fundraisers) and the donors

## This doesn't sound like a typical persona, why is that?

These personas are combining the mindset of the fictional characters mentioned above with the value proposition canvas as stating their main daily tasks, the pains and the gains. The value proposition canvas is a tool designed by a company called Strategyzer. More details of how to create one or how to understand it on a deeper level, [here](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas).

## So how can it be used?

1. First just read all of them one-by-one and try to re-live their daily tasks, additionally we also recommend maybe to visit relevant [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) channels, where the initial research about this group has taken place as well.

2. Focusing on their main pains and main gains, try to think of a feature which could help them either easing somehow their pain, or strengthen their gains.

Ready? *Here we go!*
