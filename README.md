## About this project
:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

## Getting Started

This describes how to contribute to SFN-CLIENT:  the tools we use to track and
coordinate the work that is happening and that needs to happen. This also describes the
*workflow* -- the processes and sequences for getting contributions merged into the project in an organized and coherent way.

We use [Waffle](https://waffle.io/AgileVentures/sfn-client) to manage our work on features, chores and bugfixes.

We keep our code on [GitHub](http://github.com) and use [git](https://git-scm.com) for version control.

### Forking the repository
Each developer will usually work with a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the [main repository on Agile Ventures](https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client). Before starting work on a new feature or bugfix, please ensure you have [synced your fork to upstream/develop](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/):

### Node version management :hammer_and_wrench:
Please ensure you have [nvm installed in your local machine](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If you are using OSX you can run the command below

```brew install nvm```

Run the following command to install and switch to the current node version for the project:
```
nvm install v10.13.0
```

To ensure that the correct node version for the project is automatically selected when you cd into the sfn-client project's directory please install [avn](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) in your local machine and run the commands below in your terminal:

```
npm install -g avn avn-nvm avn-n
```
OR
```
yarn global add avn avn-nvm avn-n
```
Then run:
```
avn setup
```

Unfortunately, if you are using vs code's integrated terminal, you have to `cd ..` and cd back in `cd sfn-client`

In Mac's Terminal it works automatically.

If you are using [fish shell](https://gist.github.com/idleberg/9c7aaa3abedc58694df5) please [use this](https://medium.com/@joshuacrass/nvm-on-mac-for-fish-users-e00af124c540) to install nvm and [install avn for fish](https://github.com/martinkacmar/fish-avn)

### Install yarn.
```
npm install -g yarn
```
### Run yarn to install dependencies
```
yarn
```
### Starting the development server
```
yarn start
```

### Running tests (jest)
* This codebase uses Enzyme Javascript Testing Utility. To learn more about the Enzyme you can checkout their [documentation](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

* start the test by running
    ```
    yarn test
    ```
* then press `a` to run all test

### Running eslint/standard autofix command

* You can't commit or run the tests if you have lint errors, so run:

    ```
    yarn lint:fix
    ```

### Using the debugger
* If tests are failing, or you found a bug running the development server, you can debug using the [inline debug tool](https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client/blob/develop/HOW-TO-USE-DEBUG-SCRIPT.md).

### Creating an Issue
 
- You can create an issue by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client/issues/new/choose) or by clicking on the new issue button on for [github issues](https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client/issues) for the sfn-client project
- Click on the [Get Started](https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=issue-template.md&title=) button to open the issue creation template. 
- Fill in all the relevant sections as you create your issue.
- Submit your issue by clicking on "Submit issue" button.

### Choosing Stories/tickets.

When deciding on an issue to work on, look for the  `Help Wanted` or `Good First Issue` tags.

Request to be added as a collaborator in our [AgileVentures.org Slack chat channel](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/phoenix_one).

After youâ€™re a collaborator, you can move the ticket to the `In Progress` column [here](https://waffle.io/AgileVentures/sfn-client), to indicate youâ€™ve started work on it.

### How to create a feature branch

```
git checkout develop
```
```
git pull upstream develop
```
After you pulled the latest develop branch, make sure you have also the dependencies installed each time, by running in the console:

```
yarn
```
Ensure you have setup AgileVentures/sfn-client's upstream  `develop`.  Otherwise you will not have the latest `develop ` changes.

To confirm this, run ```git remote -v```.

You should see a simillar output.

```
originÂ Â https://github.com/yourgithubusername/sfn-client.git (fetch)
originÂ Â https://github.com/yourgithubusername/sfn-client.git (push)
upstreamÂ Â Â Â https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client.git (fetch)
upstreamÂ Â Â Â https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client.git (push)
```

If not, you need to set the remote develop in order to get the latest copy once changes are merged.

In order to achieve that, run:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client
```

```
git pull upstream develop
```

This depends on the name of your origin (Counter check before running the above command).

You will now have the latest copy of develop in your local.

Once this is done, you can proceed with naming your branch following the below convention.

### Branch Naming Conventions

```
git checkout -b 17-add-sfn-logo
```


Where `17` is the ticket number and `add-sfn-logo ` is a short description of the purpose of your branch.

### Commit Messages

Ensure your commit message clearly communicate the work you have done.

For example,
```
git commit -m "Implement user login"
```

### Pull Requests

After feature branch work is complete, push up to the upstream repo, for example:
```
git push --set-upstream upstream 17-add-sfn-logo
```

For your Pull Requests, ensure you have a proper title describing your task.
Make sure to add a link to the ticket you've worked on and add any screenshots if necessary.

In your pull request description please include a sensible description of your code and a tag `fixes #<issue-id>` e.g. :

```
This PR adds a CONTRIBUTING.md file and a docs directory

fixes #799
```

which will associate the pull request with the issue in the Waffle board.

Your pull request needs to be reviewed by at least two people in the team for it to be merged in `develop` branch.

Instructions on how to review a pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/AgileVentures/sfn-client/blob/develop/HOW-TO-REVIEW-A-DEVELOP-PR.md).

### Design

#### Designing components

We try to make designing components easier with setting up some base grounds of colors, typography and layouts. Before start designing a component for the page, please consult these materials. You can find them in the src/components/styles directory.

The layout of the pages is following Bootstrap's [12 column](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) grid system, but with using [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) together. We recommend to have a look at the documentation, or just give a shot to [grid garden game](http://cssgridgarden.com/).

The structure of the components and spacing is suggested to follow an 8px grid system, what does that mean? It means every spacing, padding and size (width, height) of a component is following a multiple of 8. To give you a head start related to this rule, we set up the margins and paddings already to use in the styles/utilities.scss file as SASS variables.
